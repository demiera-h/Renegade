The renegadeRawCalculations file contains the command line program I currently use to calculate my invoices. It is rough, but runs as is.

The renegadeGUI file is running green_shoes, and contains the GUI. Not ready to be launched yet.

The renegadeClassMethods file is where I'm taking the raw calculations and making them into methods and classes. It is intended to be a more advanced version of the renegadeRawCalculations file. Still needs a lot of work; notes in file. 

This program was started in February 2016, for anyone who cares. It is written to calculate a particular kind of invoice.
